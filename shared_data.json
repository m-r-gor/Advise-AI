This option is great for covering temporary needs such as a mortgage.<br><br>Whole Life Insurance provides lifelong coverage and includes a savings component that grows over time. Though premiums are higher, they stay constant and it builds cash value that can be useful.<br><br>Universal Life Insurance offers flexible premiums and death benefits with savings that grow tax-deferred. This is nice if you want the flexibility to adjust premiums and death benefits over time.<br><br>Variable Life Insurance is similar to universal life but lets you invest the cash value in sub-accounts. This could offer higher returns but comes with more risk and varying policy value.<br><br>Considering your conservative risk profile and focus on wealth preservation, Whole Life Insurance might be the most stable option with its lifelong coverage and guaranteed cash value growth.

According to the attached documents, the following points are relevant:\n\n1. **Tax Implications on Transfer**: If you transfer property to a child at less than fair market value, specific rules apply. For instance, if the transferee (your daughter) disposes of the property before turning 18, the taxable capital gains or allowable capital losses are deemed to be those of the transferor (you)\u30104:0\u2020source\u3011\u30104:1\u2020source\u3011. This implies that any capital gains realized by your daughter from the sale of the condo might be attributed back to you if she is under 18 at the time of sale.\n\n2. **Fair Market Value Consideration**: When transferring property at less than fair market value, the difference between the fair market value and the transfer price can have tax implications. The fair market value of the property at the time of transfer is crucial in determining the taxable capital gain\u30104:3\u2020source\u3011\u30104:14\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. **Joint Liability**: Both you (the transferor) and your daughter (the transferee) could be jointly and severally liable for any tax implications arising from the transfer if it's not done at arm\u2019s length\u30104:12\u2020source\u3011\u30104:18\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. **Gift Considerations**: If the transfer is intended as a gift, it must be clearly established as such to the satisfaction of the Minister to avoid tax complications. The value of the gift and any advantage received in respect of the gift are also considered\u30104:7\u2020source\u3011.\n\nIn summary, while it is legally possible to transfer your condo to your daughter below market value, doing so to minimize capital gains tax when she sells it involves careful consideration of the tax rules and potential liabilities.
